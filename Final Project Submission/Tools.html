<h2>What I need? </h2>
<table>
<tr>
		<td><strong>Seeds and plants</strong></td>
		<td>This is your choice. Some people has said that you are not true gardener if you don't use seeds but that is not true. 
		I have used seeds and also use seedlings from nurseries. I honestly prefer seeds because I know what I did to keep them alive or if they died.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td><strong>Potting Mix</strong></td>
		<td>Use potting mix that has good drainage. I would perfer getting potting soil from Home Depot that already has fertilizer and perlite. 
		<br>It makes planting a little easier and makes the soil a little lighter. You dont want to get root rot on the plants.
		 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td><strong>Garden Tools</strong></td>
		<td>Since you are gardening in your place or patio/balcony, you will need just a few items. Rake, weeder, scissors, pruner and a spade shape trowel.
		These item you can get as a pack at any home and garden store, Amazon or even the Dollar Tree. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td><strong>Planters</strong></td>
		<td>You can any planter you want. But make sure the planters are large enough for the plant to grow. Also make sure it has a enough holes in the bottom for drainage. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td><strong>Plant Lights</strong></td>
		<td>If you have an apartment that does not have a lot of light then plant light are the best option to use.
		Plant lights can be used for houseplants that need bright light, or in any home during the dark days of winter. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
		<td><strong>Pesticide</strong></td>
		<td>Pesticide is used to kill bugs that are eating the leaves or blossoms of the plants. I don't really agree with pesticides because most of them can damage bugs and the plant itself. 
		I suggest if you use pesticides try to use natural pesticides. Neem oil pesticides is a great one to use. It's nontoxic to most animals and it's used to fight off mildew and plant fungas.
		If you have neem oil, then you need to start out with a basic mixture of two teaspoons neem oil and one teaspoon of mild liquid soap shaken thoroughly with one quart of water, and then sprayed on the affected plant foliage.
